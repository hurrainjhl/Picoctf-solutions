## Decrypting the Flag

Follow these steps to decrypt the flag using the provided Python script and password.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Download the Files:**
   - Download the necessary files:
     - `ende.py`: Python script for decryption.
     - `flag.txt.en`: Encrypted flag file.
     - `password.txt`: Password (`ac9bd0ffac9bd0ffac9bd0ffac9bd0ff`) needed for decryption.

2. **Organize the Files:**
   - Save all downloaded files in a directory on your system.

3. **Open Command Prompt / Terminal:**
   - Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).

4. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   - Change directory to where you saved the files using the `cd` command.

   Example (replace `/path/to/directory` with your actual directory path):
   ```bash
   >cd /path/to/directory
   
## Decrypting the Flag

Follow these steps to decrypt the flag using the provided Python script and password.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Run the Decryption Command:**

   Execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt to decrypt the flag:
   ```bash
   >python ende.py -d flag.txt.en ac9bd0ffac9bd0ffac9bd0ffac9bd0ff > decrypted_output.txt

 Replace 'flag.txt.en' and 'ac9bd0ffac9bd0ffac9bd0ffac9bd0ff' with the actual file names and password.



**Retrieve the Flag:**

Open the decrypted_output.txt file to view the decrypted flag.



**Notes:**

1.Ensure Python is installed and accessible from the command line (python command).

2.Replace placeholders ('/path/to/directory', file names, password) with your actual values as per your setup.


  
>In this format, all instructions, filenames, and placeholders are clearly indicated as code, making it easier for users to understand and follow the decryption process. Adjust the placeholders (`<encrypted_file>` and `<password>`) with your specific filenames and password accordingly.

>In this Markdown format, each instruction and command is formatted as code, providing clarity and emphasis on the actions users need to take to decrypt the flag. Adjust the paths, filenames, and other specifics based on your actual scenario.
